                Hello, I'm Lautaro Leal Del Prete.
                <br />
                I'm a Software Development and Quality student at Universidad del Norte Santo Tom√°s de Aquino.
                <br />
                I'm continuing my training in web development, programming, problem-solving, and teamwork. I already have experience in basic web development, customer service, and inventory control thanks to previous academic projects and jobs.
                <br />
                I'm especially motivated by teamwork. I have experience applying agile methodologies such as SCRUM, which has allowed me to develop organizational, communication, and effective collaboration skills in group projects.
                <br />
                I'm looking for opportunities to continue learning, add value to technology teams, and participate in projects that represent real challenges.
            </p>
